class Simulator(Named):
    """
    This class articulates the dynamic sequence of events that composes a discrete event system.  Its use to synchronize
    and articulate the execution of *processes*, functions that respectively describe trains of events, yields an
    elegant DSL for modeling discrete event systems. Processes are incorporated into the simulation using method
    `add()`. This will make the process functions run on green threads (so-called *greenlets*), granting the simulator
    the possibility of running a large number of concurrent processes. Green thread cooperation is transparent to the
    simulation's writer: it naturally stems from switching between concurrent events as the simulation progresses. In
    addition, green threads do not imply the use of Python multi-threading on the simulator's behalf: simulations are
    run on a single Python thread, and thus data sharing between simulation processes involve no race condition (unless
    one is explicitly implemented).

    Each event within a simulation is associated to a moment on the simulator's clock. This timeline is completely
    abstract: a 1.0 unit on this clock corresponds to whatever unit of time is convenient to the model author (such
    correspondence, when relevant, is best documented for the benefit of the users of the model). When the simulation
    runs, events are executed as fast as a single CPU allows.

    Usage of this class is simple: one sets up processes that will generate events as they execute. Then one
    invokes the run() method. The events are executed in chronological order. Processes can add yet other processes: the
    only rule is that events cannot be scheduled in the past. The simulation stops once all events have been executed,
    or one of the events invokes the stop() method of the Simulator instance; at this moment, method run() returns. It
    may be called again to resume the simulation, and so on as many times as makes sense to study the model.

    When running multiple simulations from a single process, one may become concerned that hanging processes come to
    use memory unduly. Processes hold a weak reference to the simulator they run in context of, so once all explicit
    references to the simulator are discarded, it is garbage-collected; its destructor then tears down all hanging
    processes, thereby freeing all simulation resources. However, to deliberately track and free simulation resources,
    one may use the simulator instance as a context manager, as in this example:

    with Simulator() as sim:
        sim.add(...)
        # ...
        sim.run(...)
        # ...

    Simulation resources and hanging processes are explicitly torn down on context exit.
